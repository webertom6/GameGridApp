                              REPORT
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1) Class Map could be more generic bc it depends on the Class Levels
     (the Class Map could be compiled w/out Class Levels). I made this
     choice to not have to build the Level in the same file, I found that
     a bit Strange to have those big String in the same file.
     => delete map.initLevel1() and use map.buildLevel(levels.getLevel1())
          so you don't create a levels instance in Map but just pass a String
          in the build.level

     2) ALL Class File have been deleted bc cannot be possible in a .jar so
     use of InputStream or URL. Modification have been done in SoundTrack,
     LevelSelecter, EndFrame, WinFrame and, SokobanGrid. Normally, the rest
     of the process haven't been modified i.e String for file_path

     CrateSolved finally solve, you have to use tile.getNumImage() to use the
     mechanism of several image but not possible if you use direct the int return by
     loadImage()

     3) All modifications make to the game
     V = the features have been created
     X = the features failed to be created
     => = explanation

     V -> Chose Sound or not
          => on the Info Panel use a button to clip.stop() or slip.start() the sound (decrease the volume seems not possible)

     V -> 4 different image depending on the direction chosen
          -> done but still to find image of player w/ hands in front to push
          => change the behavior of getNumImage in Player Tile and the load in Window

     V -> Using the threads to load the level when the LevelSelecter is displaying the progress bar
          => progress bar take always 2.5s but wait bar is finished before display level

     V -> Still upset by CrateSolved
          => change the state at the start, put the target under in the target_list, use tile.getNumImage()
               instead of using the num direct given by the method .loadImage(file_path)

     V -> replace the instanceof for pickable by equals(Tile.KEY) where Tile.KEY is public final int file_path.hashCode()
          => .getImage().contains("coin"), easier and hashCode() return an int different for each Object from same Class

     V -> use clone() to clone the map (clone() for tile also) and so have a reset button
          => create a clone of the map at the start and clone each Tile to place them in a new coordMap[][]
               you cannot clone target_list and crate_list bc the Tile in the coordMap and in the list must be the same
               when you modified them. So the method is not really elegant but while the main behavior of the game does not
               change it still be ok.
          => new method in Window relaunch to restart the grid but all Tile have already an NumImage
          => change the method for Item bc there are more things to clone

     V -> Set a TextField on the LevelSelecter to choose your username before a game(set enable off after level choose)
          take this username and give it to the Player, when the game is lost (Sorry Username) or win (Congrats username)
          and this username can be use for the scoreboard
          => userfield add and username store in Player Class

     X -> load each different tile once and use this number for every tile with the same image
          -> maybe inconvient to change large part of the code
          => not tried bc it changed the main logic of the SokobanGrid which take Image with a Queue
          -> loadImage every tile at beginning at store the int return in a public VAR like ENUM
          -> give all correct tile the right int .WALL_IMAGE

     X -> use serialization to make a scoreboard to store the score at the end of (better) game
          => not possible to make serialiazation in a JAR bc a JAR is a read-only resources so
               you cannot write sth in it

     X -> Now the coordMap is a 2D array but possible to create a array (or 2D array) with all the maps inside and when a
          level is finished, you go directly to the next level
          -> Need new method Game2 and instead of System.exit(0) => Player.nextlevel()
          -> All the level should have the same size
          -> example of the code which could have been used for this
               /**
               * Player.java
               *
               * nextLevel(){
               *     map.nextLevel();
               * }
               *
               * Map.java
               *
               * private Tile[][][] world;
               * private int curr_map
               *
               * nextLevel(){
               *     world[curr_map+1];
               * }
               */
          => change the complete behavior of the game but still be interesting for the future

     V -> when you win/lose, if you pressed R, the game reset and the winning/losing frame is closed
          => you have to REDUCE the winning/losing frame

     !!!!!!!!!!
     Reason why PC goes to WEWEEWEEEWEWE when game start 
     -> while loop run in loop waiting to stop by input of the userfield
     => try to do a method like .getEvent which wait an input and restart only. 
        The wait comes fro the LinkedBlockingQueue which WAIT until it has an element in it to take 

     Plan:
          Merge all the GUI in one with different panel
          use the getEvent to detect when sth have been add to queue
          make Windows extends SokobanGUI instead of put one in it
          Player class is actually the World class
          ==> find a way to continue the thread of game in back so enemy could move while the player is waiting
     !!!!!!!!!!



     x -> change all the JFrame to JPanel and use a singe JFrame to display all the feature
               -> intro: change all the big frame into a panel display the same way
               -> game: add the sokoban grid to a panel w/ the max size
               the info panel should stay the same in all case (in biggest config)
               -> end/win: big panel with config already done
               => maybe in V2

     X -> the mute bouton on the intro panel set visble a slider to change volume
          -> change also the soundtrack class bc awful

     x -> have the sense that push delegation further 
          -> ex: push a crate with another crate next, the crate should ask to futher crate(tile) if push can be done
          -> PlayerTile extends Movable and ask the futher tile what can be done

     X -> Add Portal
          -> Portal can be added  by changing walk(dx,dy)/push(dx,dy) to teleport()
          -> 2 set of coord in it
          -> teleportable attribute, walkable
          -> when walk on it, Direction.Teleport + Direction.UP/DOWN/LEFT/Right
          -> getCorrd of other portal and put the Tile +1 further in direction

     4) Notes
     -> find the way that win/end frame extends JFrame a bit barbarian
