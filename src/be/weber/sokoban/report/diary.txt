RunGame.java:
    Rename Game -> RunGame: conflict name w/ method
    scratch of the working game
    > .join() of .loadLevel() doesnt make wait for the program
    maybe bc updateBuffer direct in setCell()

Player.java:
    replace window w/ GameGUI game

LevelSelectPanel.java:
    add game method (getUsername, loadLevel, join)

LayeredFrame:
    setNPanel(): not add panel in the constructor
