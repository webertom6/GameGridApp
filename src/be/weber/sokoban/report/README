                            INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This application have been based on a school project.
-We have a common GUI(SokobanGUI.java, SokobanGrid.java, SokobanError.java)
 -> However the all functioning of this App is MINE
 -> Modified to convert into a .jar

-This is my FIRST real project so I know there are a lot of drawbacks
 -> Bad hierarchy of packages (code + resource)
 -> Throw a different SokobanError not well add to methods
 -> Use different JFrame for each window instead of clean the same one
 -> Lack of parameters for song
 -> Border not perfect on JFrame
 -> use of paint() to info panel instead of changing the text
 -> check the pickable Item w/ instance of is not a good idea
 -> I think this list is not finish =)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            SOKOBAN GAME
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of the game is to place the crate on a target no matter which one
-> An home screen appear when you launch the program, you have 4s to choose a level(it's enough),
   then it will close and start the level by it-self
-> if you failed an action, you need to close the window(and it's considered 'lost')
   there is no key available to redo or restart the level
-> once the level finish you to restart the game to choose a new one (bc no methods to close the SokobanGUI)


----------------------------------------
               TILE
----------------------------------------
->Basic Tile:
   -> Crate = can be push by player
   -> Wall = block player
   -> Target = player can walk on it/ place crate on it
   -> Floor = player can walk on it
->Supp Tile:
   -> Hole = if player walk on it -> GAME OVER
   -> RiskyFloor = player cane be walk on it once then it becomes a hole/push a box on it doesn't transform it into a hole
   -> Shift = crate without aim/you can hide something under(key, coin)
   -> Key = Item that can be picked up/use to unlock door
   -> Door = act like Wall when it's locked/act like Floor when it's unlock
   -> Coin = Item that can be picked up/not useful just to show that 2 Item can be picked up
             without having the same effect


----------------------------------------
               FEATURES
----------------------------------------
-Song:
   -> SoundTrack = used to play several song for the game
->Screen:
   -> EndFrame = show this window if player lost or quit the game
   -> WinFrame = show this window if player win
   -> LevelSelecter = used to select your level

----------------------------------------
               LEVEL
----------------------------------------
-> ZoneTest = the place where I do my tests, I left it accessible for you if you want
             but you are not supposed to have access to it(access can be easily remove in LevelSelecter)
-> Level n°1 = level easy from the statement
-> Level n°2 = level with my tile add
  -> solution n°2: the first key is under the grey box at the start, you have to begin with the up part
                   to find the second key and finish the level

----------------------------------------
               CODE
----------------------------------------
-> Cast = when I cast a variable Tile as an Item due to the principle of polymorphism,
         I check before that Tile has a property that require a cast so there can't be an error during the cast
-> Image of Tile = the first image display is always the default image (from state = false)
-> Direction = I know it's a classic Enum but it's necessary to use 'public static final int' for
              each direction explanation in the file
-> Thread = the only thread on which I make operation is the main to bc it is the only one currently running
-> try/catch and throws = only constructors and the main have a try/catch and the methods just throw error

----------------------------------------
               NOTES
----------------------------------------
-> all the methods in the package tile have an access modifier = public. It's mandatory bc they are in other package.
  If all the class were in the .main, you can use the access modifier = protected, but I think it lack visibility
  with all those class in the .main

-> I don't know if it's relevant but I find it quite convenient that if someone wants to implements a new Tile
  he has just to create a new Class with the file path of the image that he wants, set a common property to all Tile
  and ofc if he wants that new Tile changes its property in function its state
